  <h4>
    Once upon a time when there were still wild horses roaming the countryside and I was hiking through the ancient forests of Romania.
    My eyes caught a glimpse of some kind of light coming from a cave, covert in green bushy business, you couldn't really see it was a cave. But with each step closer the smell of wet stone, burning coal and soup made it clear to me, there was cave.
    I pushed some bushes aside and struggled through the sticky greenery, when I reached the entrance I felt the warmth of a beautifully lighted home. A lot of drawings and paintings were scattered all over the place and some bright coloured woven tapestries were decorating the walls.
    In the background I heard some noises that sounded like grunts and behind a bigger rock in the middle of the room there was a person sitting in front of screen, creating images with his fingers.
